Network bandwidth usage is abnormally high Use network monitoring tools to identify the source of high bandwidth usage. Consider implementing traffic shaping or Quality of Service (QoS) policies to prioritize network traffic.

Network latency is too high Check for network congestion or packet loss using tools like ping or traceroute. Optimize network settings to reduce latency, such as adjusting TCP window size or enabling TCP Fast Open.

Cannot access the internet through a proxy server Verify proxy server settings in the network configuration. Check firewall settings to allow traffic through the proxy server. Ensure that the proxy server is operational and correctly configured.

Network time synchronization fails Check if the NTP (Network Time Protocol) service is running on the server. Verify firewall settings to allow NTP traffic. Try using a different NTP server.

Network traffic from specific applications is blocked Review firewall settings to allow traffic from the affected applications. Check for any application-specific proxy settings. Ensure that there are no restrictive policies in place at the network level.

Cannot resolve hostnames Verify DNS server settings in the network configuration. Try using a different DNS server. Check for any local DNS cache issues on the client machine.

Network printer prints garbled text Ensure that the correct printer driver is installed on the client machine. Check printer settings for compatibility with the document format. Try printing a test page to diagnose the issue.

Cannot obtain an IP address from DHCP server Check network cable connections and ensure that the DHCP server is reachable. Verify DHCP server configuration settings, such as address pool and lease duration. Try restarting the DHCP service.

Network interface is in a 'down' state Use the 'ifconfig' or 'ip' command to bring the interface up manually. Check for any hardware issues with the network adapter. Investigate system logs for any errors related to the network interface.

Network routing is incorrect Review the routing table using the 'route' command. Check for any incorrect or conflicting routes. Ensure that the default gateway is set correctly. Try flushing the routing table and adding routes manually.

Cannot access network shares from Windows Ensure that Samba service is running on the Linux server. Verify the permissions and configuration of the shared folders. Check firewall settings to allow SMB (Server Message Block) traffic.

Network cable is unplugged Check network cable connections at both ends. Ensure that the cable is securely plugged into the network adapter and the router or switch. Replace the cable if necessary.

Network throughput is lower than expected Check for any network congestion or bandwidth limitations. Verify that the network equipment (router, switch) is capable of handling the expected throughput. Consider upgrading network hardware if necessary.

Network adapter is in promiscuous mode Use the 'ifconfig' or 'ip' command to disable promiscuous mode on the network adapter. Investigate any applications or services that may be causing the adapter to enter promiscuous mode.

Cannot establish an FTP connection Check FTP server settings and ensure that the correct authentication method is used. Verify firewall settings to allow FTP traffic. Try using passive mode for FTP connections.

Network printer is offline Check the printer's power and network connections. Verify that the printer is turned on and connected to the network. Restart the printer and try printing a test page.

Network device MAC address is changing Investigate if there are any rogue DHCP servers on the network. Check for malware or unauthorized devices altering network settings. Enable MAC address filtering on the router or switch.

Network adapter driver is outdated. Update the driver to the latest version provided by the manufacturer.

Cannot access a specific website. Check if the website is down or blocked by firewall rules.

Network printer is out of paper. Refill the paper tray and try printing again.

DHCP lease time is too short. Increase the lease duration in the DHCP server configuration.

Network cable is damaged. Replace the damaged cable with a new one.

Network congestion due to excessive multicast traffic. Identify and reduce multicast traffic on the network.

Network switch port is malfunctioning. Test the port with another device or replace the switch.
